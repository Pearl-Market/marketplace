# PEARL
PEARL is where typedesigners and designers can create, sell, and discover and source typefaces and designs.
With PEARL, we want to onboard the creative ecosystem on-chain, from designing creative assets, selling, and sharing designs, while bringing back the value they create to the designers.

## Type Designer Workflow
 - Upload font Preview Image (Implemented)
 - Create font Collection
 - Upload and ecrypt files (only feature Preview no UI)

## Graphic Designer Workflow
 - Browse NFTs (Implemented)
 - Buy NFT (Implemented)
 - Unlock and download ecrypted files (only feature Preview no UI)
 - Create own Designs (Not Implemented)
 - Create it's own collection of designs (Not Implemented)


## Storage
We store the NFT Font preview on IPFS using nft.storage.
We also store the encrypted font files, Specimen image, Licence on IPFS using nft.storage as well.

## Lit Protocol
In our demo our accessControlCondition is controlling at least 1 ERC721 Font NFT.
The Encyrpted files by the type designer can be decrypted if you own a font.
